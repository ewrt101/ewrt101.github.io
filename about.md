---

Started Uni in 2018 and finished the last of my uni work at the very end of 2020 but april 2021 is when i graduated (16th april).

Went to uni for software engineering but swap to computer science after the first year. Covered a wide range of todo with computer science, everything from networking to basic OS and even a bit of game dev.

Big into making Vr stuff and game in genral. Started with Uinty in 2013 in my first year at highschool but never made anything i can show off. My current project (the bull hell one) is supposted to fix that problem, started work on it in late march so still very new but check out my project page to learn more.
