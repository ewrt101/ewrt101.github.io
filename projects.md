#### Vulkan Game engine  
A simple Vulkan based Game engine. im following this tutoral by [Brendan Galea](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9pXmjxsQHeFH9vgCeRsHcw) on youtube.
Its only something i work on every now and then you can see my current progress on my github. Currently only renders a pretty tringle 

#### VRChat backup pull
A old command line tool to pull avatar backups from the VRC servers when future proofing was left on.
Tool is old and out of date but still works as far as i can tell. In need to a rewrite as it was all hacked togother as i was learning the VRC API

Not something i plan on give out to the public as it can be used to steal avatars aswell.
But hit me up on discord if you really need it and i might be able to help.


#### VRChat tool
Old broken tool to see what friends were online, send custom messages over the invite system and join on friends.
Was made when VRC ingame friends list were slow to update. 

Broke when the new invite message system came out but fell out of use when the max api rates were lower 6 months earlier.
No plans to update as its not really needed anymore and not worth the risk of being ip banned for to many API pulls
