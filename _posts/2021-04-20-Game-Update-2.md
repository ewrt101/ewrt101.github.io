Got the start of a map working.

The untextured model of the map. Its a simple stage design with a tower to dispaly a leader board and some other stuff.

Simple stage with a platform that floats up a tunnle to the middle of the stage.

There is plans to add more stages later for diffrent game modes but this is all i plan todo for the first prototype.

Next is to fix a few bugs, get a simple leaderboard working and then place a build on steam for testing.
