Got the first verson up on my steam App Id, so i can now have friends test the game.

I have come across a the cause frame times to dip, i think its the openVR runtime and im hoping the next verson of unity will fix it. If a new verson of unity dosent help i will go back to debugging.

All in all progress has been made.

On a side note i have started working on textures as showen in the picuture above. Im going to need to pick up a quixel PERSONAL licence but that can wait will i can spend the money.

If you want to help test the game, hit me up on discord.
