Got a lot of stuff done the last month.

Got the steam playtest system up and running, tho i need to finish the main store page befor i can use it.

updated the textures to look better.

changed the bullet speed to be related to the fire rate.

also did some light fixes

Still having problems with the OpenXR runtime

I had a week of not working on this as i had a few job interviews but unfortunately didnt go anywhere.
