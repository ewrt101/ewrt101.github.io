Got the start of my bullet hell game working.

Getting here was a challenge, dealing with the brand new OpenXR system was a mission. I had a massive lag problem and after a good week of debuging it turns out all i needed to do was jump to the alpha verson of unity and it fixed it. YAY for in progress fetures.

The game now has most of the core prototype systems inplace, so the game can now be played to some degree. There is still a long way to go but now that the big lag problem is fixed i should make some quick progress.

Next up is some basic model work in blender, wish me luck.
